      <p>The dollar slice is one of those "only in New York" things. With inflation and rising costs of materials and labor, though, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/nyregion/pizza-inflation.html">many fear</a> that this staple of the city's dining scene is going extinct.</p>
      
      <p>But maybe this legend will never die. Liam Quigley, a New York-based journalist, recently published <a href="https://elkue.com/nyc-slice/">a website</a> detailing his eight-year-long pizza project. From 2014 to 2022, he logged each slice of pizza he ate in New York City with details where and wheen he ate it, and the price and style of the slice. </p>
