      <p>The dollar slice is one of those "only in New York" things. With inflation and rising costs of materials and labor, though, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/nyregion/pizza-inflation.html" target="blank">many fear</a> that this staple of the city's dining scene is going extinct.</p>
      
      <p>But maybe this legend will never die. Liam Quigley, a New York-based journalist, recently published <a href="https://elkue.com/nyc-slice/" target="blank">a website</a> detailing his eight-year-long pizza project. From 2014 to 2022, he logged each slice of pizza he ate in New York City with details like where and when he ate it, and the price and style of the slice.</p>
      
      <p>Quigley's data of nearly 400 slices of plain pizza (out of 450+ total) showed a rise in the average price over the years. But even as prices rose overall, the renowned dollar slice held on in some stores.</p>
